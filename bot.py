Pacrooti Bot Commands

This bot creates a roster for where folks can sign up for guild trial events.

- To sign up for a role in a trial click the emoji on the roster for the role you want to go as.  If you click the same
emoji twice you will be put on the backup roster for that role.
Tank Emoji = {TANK_EMOJI}
Healer Emoji = {HEAL_EMOJI}
Melee DPS Emoji = {MELEE_EMOJI}
Ranged DPS Emoji = {RANGED_EMOJI}
Unsignup from Roster Emoji = {UNSIGNUP_EMOJI}

- To create a new trial (requires perms) type the following in the channel you want to the roster to post in.
!NewTrial <number of tanks> <number of healers> <number of DPS> <Name and description of trial>

Example to create a trial with 1 tank 2 healers and 9 DPS:
**!NewTrial 1 2 9 Friday Night Trial with Pacbot**

- To add someone to a trial roster (requires perms)
!AddtoTrial <TrialID> @Users Discord Name <emoji for role>

Example to add a user named someome to an existing trial as a healer with an ID of 123456
**!AddtoTrial 123456 @Someone {HEAL_EMOJI}**

- You can remove someone from the trial by using the !AddtoTrial command with the {UNSIGNUP_EMOJI} emoji.

Example to remove a user named someone from trial 123456
**!AddtoTrial 123456 @Someone {UNSIGNUP_EMOJI}**
